Save a lot of your time by scrolling less in WP admin! A small UX improvement will keep Publish Button within reach and return the scrollbar to its position after saving.



== Description ==

Too often it turns out very inconvenient to scroll WordPress admin page back and forth in the quest for a big blue button to save latest changes. 

Simple jQuery script of this plugin will duplicate Update / Publish / Save Changes / etc. button for posts, pages, custom posts, taxonomies, user profiles and settings to the top WordPress admin bar, so it will stay on site when you are scrolling your admin page. The plugin options allow to keep scrollbar position after saving.

The plugin doesn't affect any native WordPress functionality. It just redirects your click to the original button. The plugin, also, uses current button text, of course with the current language.



== Installation ==

1. Upload plugin folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in the WordPress admin

3. Change settings on Settings -> Toolbar Publish Button if you wish

4. Enjoy the clone of the Update / Publish button on the admin top toolbar when editing posts, pages and custom post types.
