Get rid of excessive scrolling when saving data on WordPress backend! A small UX improvement will keep Publish Button and/or Main Admin Menu in sight.



== Description ==

Too often it turns out very inconvenient to scroll WordPress admin page back and forth in the quest for a big blue button to save latest changes. 

Simple jQuery script of this plugin will duplicate Update / Publish / Save Changes / etc. button for posts, pages, custom posts, taxonomies, user profiles and settings to the top WordPress admin bar menu so, that it is staying on site when you are scrolling your admin page. 

The plugin options allow to keep scrollbar position after saving and stick admin main menu on its place when you're scrolling the page.

The plugin doesn't affect any native WordPress functionality. It just redirects your click to an original button. The plugin, also, uses current button text, of course with the current language.



== Installation ==

1. Upload plugin folder to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in the WordPress admin

3. Change settings on Settings -> Toolbar Publish Button if you wish

4. Enjoy the clone of the Update / Publish button on the Toolbar when editing posts, pages and custom post types.
